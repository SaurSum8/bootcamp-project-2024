          Just returned from my first hackathon, CalHacks 11.0. It was an
          absolute blast!
          <br />
          Even though we weren't able to fully finish our planned project, I had
          lots of fun working with my team.
          <br />
          We tried to make a voluntary computational resource sharing platform,
          AirPool.
          <br />
          Anyone could share their ideas, and the code needed to be computed.
          This could be large data analysis project, huge neural networks, etc.
          <br />
          Donors would then vote and choose to donate their computer power to
          the project of their choice.
          <br />
          This project would greatly help startups or small developer teams that
          have little to no money, but are working on ambitious projects!
