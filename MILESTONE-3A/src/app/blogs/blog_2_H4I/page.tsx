          What is Hack4Impact?
          <br />
          Hack4Impact is a student-run nonprofit group, that connects students
          with other nonprofits, to create software that helps them do their
          work more efficiently.
          <br />
          Hack4Impact's main initiative is to provide nonprofits with software
          they otherwise would never be able to have.
          <br />
          Working with nonprofits across the world, Hack4Impact members build
          products to improve the functions of effective nonprofits in their
          local communities.
