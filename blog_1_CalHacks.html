        <p>
          Just returned from my first hackathon, CalHacks 11.0. It was an
          absolute blast!<br />
          Even though we weren't able to fully finish our planned project, I had
          lots of fun working with my team.<br />
          We tried to make a voluntary computational resource sharing platform,
          AirPool.<br />
          Anyone could share their ideas, and the code needed to be computed.
          This could be large data analysis project, huge neural networks,
          etc.<br />
          Donors would then vote and choose to donate their computer power to
          the project of their choice.<br />This project would greatly help
          startups or small developer teams that have little to no money, but
          are working on ambitious projects!
